![poster](https://github.com/jakwisn/DTU-Advanced-Deep-Learning-In-Computer-Vision/blob/main/ADLiCV_Poster___Exam_Variant%20(2).pdf)

## Week 1 
* [X] create dataloader 
* [X] design transformations that are consistent to train/test images and scale them down/crop to small, consistent image. 
* [X] create transformations (do not destroy the pictures!)
    * [X] linear 
    * [ ] exponential
    * [ ] logarithmic 
    * [X] gamma adjustment (opencv)
    * [ ] linear mapping function (https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~rynson/papers/eccv22b.pdf)
* [X] ask Morten for tips on aproaching weight initialization in stable diffusion
## Week 2 
* [X] implement the stable diffuction model (ground up? using some weights?)
* [X] pick and create metrics   
* [X] try training

## Week 3 
* [X] train using different transformations 
* [X] measure the results and add them to table 
* [X] compare with some papers
* [X] compare visually

## Week 4  
* [X] make a poster
